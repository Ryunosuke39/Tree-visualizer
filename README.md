# Tree Visualizer 

 Technologies: React, HTML, CSS

## 1. What is this project?
   - This project allow you to visualize variable Binary Search Tree Data Structure on Web-Page.
   - You can add nodes, deleted nodes, find nodes by using buttons.
   - You can also set number of node to be inserted, then click generate button to generate random Binary Search Tree Data Structure!
   - I am Planning to add AVL Tree for the update! ( and also UI desing... )
   
## 2. Intension Behind This Project
   As a student who major computer science related degree, I understand that a lot of student struggle to learn Data Structrue and Algorithm especially if it's their first intaraction with this topic.
   I was also the one who hated learning complexed things, and I still remember that the day I got 0 mark for my very first assignment( worht 40 percent ), which was "Writing Binary Search Tree from Scratch".
   Then I successfully get full mark for the next assignment( which was expected to take 4 weeks but I've done it in a week) by building AVL Tree by spending tons of hours to wirte its structure on papers with pan to understand its structures.
   This is why I strongly belived that by visualizing them by myself on the paper, you can understand them much more easily. But writing bunch of tree pattern is quite exacusting and time consuming task. 
   That i why I build this project which enable you generate Binary Search Tree, and allow more interaction with that generated tree such as adding, deleting, and finding nodes!!!
